// FIRST ASSIGNMENT RTOS - Galvagni Gianluca s5521188

// APPLICATION:
// <1> Design an application with 3 threads J1, J2, J3, whose periods are 300ms, 500ms, and 800ms, plus an aperiodic thread J4 in background which is triggered by J2.
// <2> The threads shall just "waste time," as we did in the exercise with threads.
// <3> Design a simple driver with only open, close, and write system calls.
// <4> During its execution, every task 
//     (a) opens the special file associated with the driver;
//     (b) writes to the driver its identifier plus open square brackets (i.e., [1, [2, [3, or [4);
//     (c) close the special files;
//     (d) performs operations (i.e., wasting time);
//     (e) performs (i)(ii) and (iii) again to write to the driver its identifier, but with closed square brackets (i.e., 1], 2], 3] or 4]).
// <5> The write system call writes on the kernel log the string received from the thread. A typical output of the system, when reading the kernel log, 
//     can be the following [11][2[11]2][3[11]3][4]. This sequence clearly shows that some threads can be preempted by other threads (if this does not happen, 
//     try to increase the computational time of longer tasks).
// <6> Finally, modify the code of all tasks to use semaphores. Every thread now protects all its operations (i) to (v) with a semaphore, 
//     which prevents other tasks from preempting. Specifically, use semaphores with a priority ceiling access protocol.
